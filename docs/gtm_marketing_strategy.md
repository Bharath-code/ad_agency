# 🚀 Go-To-Market & Marketing Strategy
## AI Visibility Intelligence

> **Status:** Pre-Launch  
> **Target Launch:** Q1 2026  
> **Budget:** $0-$5K/month (bootstrap)  
> **Team:** Solo founder

## 📊 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### The Problem
AI assistants (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) are becoming the first stop for software buying decisions. Yet founders have **zero visibility** into whether their products are being recommended—or why competitors win.

### The Solution
AI Visibility Intelligence = "Google Search Console for AI Assistants."

### Target Customer
- **ICP:** B2B SaaS founders, $10K-$500K ARR
- **Pain Level:** 8/10 (actively losing to competitors in AI recommendations)
- **Willingness to Pay:** $79-$199/month

### 12-Month Goals
| Metric | Month 3 | Month 6 | Month 12 |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| MRR | $5,000 | $15,000 | $50,000 |
| Customers | 50 | 150 | 400 |
| Churn | <8% | <5% | <3% |
| NPS | 40+ | 50+ | 60+ |

### Customer Interview Script

```
Hi [Name], I'm building a tool to help SaaS founders understand how AI assistants 
like ChatGPT describe their products.

Quick question: When someone asks ChatGPT "best [your category] tools," do you 
know if your product gets mentioned?

[Wait for response]

If I could show you:
1. How often you appear vs competitors
2. Why competitors win when you don't
3. 3 specific fixes to improve your AI visibility

Would that be valuable for you?
```

**Target:** 20 customer interviews before launch.

I built [Product Name] to track AI visibility.
