STRESS-TEST: INVESTOR OBJECTIONS & ANSWERS
❓ “What if OpenAI changes everything?”

Answer

“We don’t depend on internals—only observable outputs. If behavior changes, our data becomes more valuable.”
❓ “Isn’t this just SEO again?”

Answer

“Yes—and that’s the point. Every new distribution layer creates a new analytics category.”

❓ “Can OpenAI build this themselves?”

Answer

“They’re focused on users, not business analytics. Platforms historically don’t build third-party visibility tools.”

❓ “How do you avoid regulatory or policy risk?”

Answer

“We don’t influence or manipulate AI systems. We analyze patterns—similar to analytics tools.”

❓ “Is this a feature, not a company?”

Answer

“Search Console wasn’t a feature—it created an ecosystem. Visibility creates workflows, retention, and data moats.”

❓ “What if AI stops recommending tools?”

Answer

“Then companies still need to know how they’re being described—or omitted. Visibility still matters.”
