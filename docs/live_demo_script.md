# 3️⃣ LIVE DEMO WALKTHROUGH SCRIPT (5–7 MINUTES)

This is what you say **word for word**.

---

## 🎤 OPENING (30 sec)

> “AI assistants are becoming the first place users ask what tools to use.
> But founders have no visibility into how their product is being recommended — or ignored.”

Pause.

---

## 🎤 PROBLEM (45 sec)

> “If ChatGPT recommends your competitor instead of you, you probably won’t know — and you won’t know why.”

---

## 🎤 PRODUCT INTRO (30 sec)

> “AI Visibility Intelligence shows you exactly how AI assistants talk about your product, and what to fix.”

---

## 🎤 LIVE WALKTHROUGH (3–4 min)

**Step 1 — Dashboard**

> “This is your AI visibility score.
> It tells you how often you appear in high-intent AI answers.”

**Step 2 — Missed opportunities**

> “Here are questions where competitors are recommended instead.”

Click one.

**Step 3 — Insight**

> “For this query, PostHog appears because of clearer positioning and comparison content.”

**Step 4 — Fix**

> “And here’s exactly what to change — positioning, content, and messaging.”

Pause again.

---

## 🎤 CLOSE (30 sec)

> “We don’t manipulate AI systems.
> We give founders clarity so they can adapt.”

---

## 🎤 CTA (FINAL)

> “If you want to stop guessing how AI sees your product, run a free scan.
> Most founders find at least one missed opportunity in the first report.”

Stop talking.

## Last coaching note (important)

This MVP wins because it:

* **Explains reality**
* **Respects trust**
* **Saves founders time**

Do not add features.
Do not chase polish.
Do not wait for permission.

You are early — act like it.
