YC / DEMO DAY VERSION (2–3 MINUTES)

This is compressed, punchy, inevitable.

YC OPENING (10 sec)

“AI assistants are replacing search as the first place users ask what to use.”

PROBLEM (20 sec)

“But companies have zero visibility into how they’re being recommended—or ignored.”

SOLUTION (20 sec)

“We’re building the Search Console for AI assistants.”

PRODUCT (30 sec)

“We show founders when AI mentions their product, when competitors win instead, and what to fix.”

WHY NOW (20 sec)

“The behavior shift happened first. Tooling always follows.”

TRACTION (15 sec)

“Founders are already paying for this clarity.”

BUSINESS MODEL (10 sec)

“Simple SaaS. Weekly retention loop.”

CLOSE (10 sec)

“If AI is the new decision layer, companies need visibility. We’re building that layer.”

Stop.
Smile.
Done.
