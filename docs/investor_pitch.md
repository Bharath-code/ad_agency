No hype. No buzzwords. Clear logic.

# 🧠 INVESTOR PITCH DECK OUTLINE

**Company:** AI Visibility Intelligence
**Tagline:** The analytics layer for AI recommendations

---

## SLIDE 1 — TITLE

**AI Visibility Intelligence**
*The Search Console for AI assistants*

Small subtext:

> Helping companies understand how AI systems recommend their products — and why they don’t.

Footer:

* Founder name
* Contact
* Date

---

## SLIDE 2 — THE SHIFT (WHY THIS EXISTS)

**AI assistants are becoming the new decision layer**

Bullets:

* Users now ask ChatGPT what tools to use
* AI recommendations influence purchasing decisions
* This behavior is accelerating, not experimental

One-liner:

> “We’re moving from search results to direct answers.”

This slide frames inevitability.

---

## SLIDE 3 — THE PROBLEM

**AI recommendations are opaque to businesses**

Bullets:

* Companies don’t know if they’re being recommended
* Competitors win silently
* There’s no dashboard, analytics, or feedback loop
* Founders are flying blind

Short sentence at bottom:

> “AI is influencing revenue — without visibility.”

---

## SLIDE 4 — THE INSIGHT (ANCHOR SLIDE)

**This is the SEO moment of AI**

Text:

* Google Search Console made SEO measurable
* Before it, businesses guessed
* AI assistants are at the same stage today

Key line:

> “Every new distribution layer eventually needs analytics.”

This slide makes the company feel *obvious*.

---

## SLIDE 5 — THE SOLUTION

**AI Visibility Intelligence**

One-sentence description:

> A B2B SaaS that shows when and why AI assistants recommend (or ignore) your product — and what to fix.

What it does:

* Tracks AI mentions for high-intent questions
* Identifies competitor advantages
* Provides actionable positioning fixes

No “control”, no “influence” language.

---

## SLIDE 6 — PRODUCT (HOW IT WORKS)

**Simple, repeatable workflow**

1. Company adds brand + competitors
2. Platform analyzes fixed high-intent AI queries
3. System detects mentions, position, sentiment
4. Weekly visibility score + recommendations

Footer:

> Pattern-based analysis. No manipulation.

---

## SLIDE 7 — PRODUCT SNAPSHOT (VISUAL SLIDE)

(Describe verbally if no screenshots yet)

* AI Visibility Score
* Missed opportunities
* Competitor mentions
* Recommended fixes

Caption:

> “Founders see in minutes why competitors are winning.”

---

## SLIDE 8 — WHO USES THIS (ICP)

**Primary customer**

* SaaS founders
* Indie hackers
* Early growth teams
* Revenue-driven, not brand-driven

Who it’s *not* for:

* Consumer brands
* Ad agencies
* Anyone trying to game AI systems

This signals focus and credibility.

---

## SLIDE 9 — WHY NOW

**Timing is the advantage**

Bullets:

* ChatGPT & AI assistants hit mass adoption
* Businesses are already reacting
* No dominant analytics tool exists
* Behavior shift happened before tooling

Key line:

> “The window before standards form is where new companies are built.”

---

## SLIDE 10 — TRACTION (EARLY IS OK)

Examples (use what you have):

* Paying early users
* Founders actively asking about AI visibility
* Manual scans converting to paid plans
* Strong weekly engagement signals

If very early:

> “Early users are paying to understand why AI recommends competitors.”

Demand > scale at this stage.

---

## SLIDE 11 — BUSINESS MODEL

**Simple SaaS pricing**

* Free: limited scan
* Indie: $49/month
* Startup: $149/month
* Growth: $499/month

Future upsells:

* Positioning audits
* Team access
* Advanced reporting

This reassures investors.

---

## SLIDE 12 — MARKET OPPORTUNITY

**Every company that cares about distribution**

You can say:

* SaaS companies first
* Expand to marketplaces, fintech, dev tools

Avoid huge TAM math unless asked.

Key sentence:

> “AI visibility becomes a standard line item.”

---

## SLIDE 13 — DEFENSIBILITY / MOAT

Pick **2**, not all.

Options:

* Accumulated longitudinal AI behavior data
* Structured intent libraries by industry
* High switching costs via weekly reporting
* Founder trust & workflow integration

Phrase it simply:

> “The data compounds.”

---

## SLIDE 14 — COMPETITION

**Status quo**

* Guessing
* Manual checks
* SEO tools not designed for AI

**Existing tools**

* Not tracking AI answers
* Not decision-focused

Key line:

> “This category doesn’t exist yet — which is the opportunity.”

---

## SLIDE 15 — VISION

**Long-term**

> “The standard infrastructure layer companies use to manage how AI systems represent them.”

Future:

* AI distribution OS
* Industry benchmarks
* AI-native analytics category leader

Big, but grounded.

---

## SLIDE 16 — TEAM

Founder slide:

* Technical + product
* Distribution-aware
* Building close to customers

If solo:

> “Founder-led, customer-driven.”

That’s acceptable early.

---

## SLIDE 17 — ASK

**Raising:** (insert round)
**Use of funds:**

* Product development
* Early customers
* Data moat

Close with:

> “We’re building the Search Console moment for AI.”

---

# 🎯 HOW TO PRESENT THIS DECK (IMPORTANT)

* Speak calmly
* Pause often
* Don’t over-explain
* Let investors connect dots

Never say:
❌ “We manipulate ChatGPT”
❌ “We control AI answers”

Always say:
✅ “We analyze patterns”
✅ “We provide visibility”

---

## FINAL COACHING NOTE

This deck works because:

* It’s inevitable
* It’s understandable
* It’s early

Investors don’t need certainty — they need **clarity + timing**.

---

SPEAKER NOTES — SLIDE BY SLIDE (WHAT YOU SAY)

These are spoken notes, not slide text.
Read calmly. Pause often. Don’t rush.

SLIDE 1 — TITLE

What you say

“We’re AI Visibility Intelligence. We help companies understand how AI assistants recommend their products—and why they don’t.”

Pause.
Let them absorb the category.

SLIDE 2 — THE SHIFT

“Users are changing how they make decisions.
Instead of searching and comparing links, they’re asking AI assistants directly what to use.”

“That shift is already here—and it’s accelerating.”

SLIDE 3 — THE PROBLEM

“When an AI assistant recommends a competitor instead of you, you usually don’t know it happened—and you don’t know why.”

“There’s no analytics, no dashboard, no feedback loop.”

SLIDE 4 — THE INSIGHT

“This is the same moment SEO was in before Google Search Console existed.”

“Before that tool, companies guessed. After it, SEO became a discipline.”

Pause.
This is the mental anchor.

SLIDE 5 — THE SOLUTION

“AI Visibility Intelligence shows when AI assistants mention your product, which competitors appear instead, and what’s missing in your positioning.”

“We don’t manipulate AI systems—we analyze observable patterns.”

Say this clearly.

SLIDE 6 — HOW IT WORKS

“Companies add their brand and competitors.”

“We analyze fixed, high-intent AI questions—like comparisons and alternatives.”

“Then we generate a visibility score and concrete recommendations.”

SLIDE 7 — PRODUCT SNAPSHOT

“Founders can see missed opportunities in minutes.”

“The most common reaction is: ‘Oh—now I see why we’re losing.’”

That line matters.

SLIDE 8 — CUSTOMER

“We’re focused on SaaS founders and early growth teams.”

“They already care about distribution—and they’re already reacting to AI influence.”

SLIDE 9 — WHY NOW

“The behavior shift happened before the tooling.”

“That gap is where new categories are created.”

SLIDE 10 — TRACTION

“Even early, founders are paying for clarity.”

“They’re not buying traffic—they’re buying understanding.”

Avoid metrics inflation.

SLIDE 11 — BUSINESS MODEL

“Simple SaaS pricing. Low friction. High retention driven by weekly reports.”

“This becomes a recurring operational cost.”

SLIDE 12 — MARKET

“Any company that cares about distribution will need to understand AI recommendations.”

Stop there. Don’t TAM-bomb.

SLIDE 13 — MOAT

“The data compounds over time.”

“Longitudinal AI behavior data plus intent libraries create switching costs.”

SLIDE 14 — COMPETITION

“Right now, the alternative is guessing—or manual checks.”

“SEO tools aren’t built for AI answers.”

SLIDE 15 — VISION

“Long term, this becomes the standard analytics layer for AI-driven distribution.”

SLIDE 16 — TEAM

“Founder-led, technical, and close to customers.”

Short. Confident.

SLIDE 17 — ASK

“We’re raising to build the product and own this category early.”

Stop talking.
