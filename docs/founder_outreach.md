Good. You need **both** — but for **different moments**.

Below are **battle-tested scripts**, not polite fluff.

---

# 1️⃣ FOUNDER OUTREACH SCRIPT (GET FIRST CUSTOMERS)

Your goal is **conversation**, not pitching.
You’re selling **insight**, not software.

---

## 🔹 CONTEXT: WHO YOU MESSAGE

Target:

* SaaS founders
* Indie hackers
* Seed–Series A
* Clear competitors

Channels:

* X (Twitter)
* LinkedIn
* Email (cold but personalized)

---

## 🔹 SCRIPT #1 — “YOU’RE INVISIBLE” (HIGH RESPONSE)

**Use when you’ve checked their brand manually**

```
Hey {{Name}},

Quick heads-up — I checked how {{Product}} shows up when people ask ChatGPT questions like:
“{{High-intent query}}”

Right now, you’re not mentioned, but {{Competitor}} is.

We’re building a tool that shows founders *why* this happens and what to fix.
Happy to share what we found if it’s useful.
```

Why this works:

* Specific
* Non-salesy
* Triggers curiosity + fear
* Founder-to-founder tone

---

## 🔹 SCRIPT #2 — “FREE VISIBILITY SCAN” (EASY YES)

```
Hey {{Name}},

We’re running quick AI visibility scans for a few SaaS founders.

It shows:
- When ChatGPT recommends your product
- When it doesn’t
- Which competitors show up instead

No pitch — just sharing the data.
Want me to run one for {{Product}}?
```

This converts insanely well.

---

## 🔹 SCRIPT #3 — AFTER THEY SAY “YES”

```
Nice — quick questions:
1) Top 2 competitors?
2) Main use-case you sell for?

I’ll send you a short summary today.
```

Speed = trust.

---

## 🔹 SCRIPT #4 — CONVERT TO PAID (SOFT CLOSE)

After you send results:

```
Quick follow-up.

We’re turning this into a live dashboard so founders can:
- Track visibility weekly
- Catch competitor mentions early
- Get clear recommendations

We’re onboarding a few early users at $49/month.
No contracts. Cancel anytime.

Want early access?
```

Do NOT negotiate early.
Signal confidence.

---

# 2️⃣ INVESTOR-GRADE NARRATIVE (WHEN IT MATTERS)

This is how you explain the company in **one breath**.

---

## 🔹 THE OPENING (HOOK)

> “AI assistants are becoming the new decision layer.
> But companies have zero visibility into how they’re being recommended.”

Pause. Let that land.

---

## 🔹 THE PROBLEM (CRISP)

> “Millions of users now ask ChatGPT what tools to use, but founders have no dashboard, no analytics, and no way to understand why competitors are recommended instead.”

Key phrase:
**“AI is opaque to businesses.”**

---

## 🔹 THE SHIFT (WHY NOW)

> “This is the same moment SEO was in before Google Search Console existed.”

This anchors understanding.

---

## 🔹 THE SOLUTION (CLEAR, NON-HYPE)

> “We’re building the visibility and analytics layer for AI recommendations — showing when your product appears, when it doesn’t, and what to fix.”

No buzzwords.
No ‘agents’.
No nonsense.

---

## 🔹 WHY YOU WIN (MOAT)

Say **one** of these depending on audience:

**Version A (Technical investors):**

> “We’re building structured intent maps and longitudinal AI behavior data — this compounds and becomes defensible.”

**Version B (Product investors):**

> “Once founders rely on weekly AI visibility reports, switching becomes painful.”

---

## 🔹 TRACTION (EVEN IF EARLY)

Even this is enough:

> “Founders are already paying to understand why ChatGPT recommends competitors over them.”

Signal demand, not scale.

---

## 🔹 MARKET SIZE (DON’T OVERDO IT)

> “Every company that cares about distribution will need to understand AI recommendation systems.”

That’s it.
Don’t say TAM unless asked.

---

## 🔹 THE VISION (STRONG CLOSE)

> “In five years, this becomes the standard infrastructure layer companies use to manage how AI systems represent them — the Search Console of the AI era.”

Stop talking.

---

# ⚠️ THINGS YOU MUST NOT SAY (EVER)

❌ “We control ChatGPT”
❌ “We influence rankings”
❌ “We guarantee visibility”
❌ “We manipulate AI”

Say instead:
✅ “We analyze patterns”
✅ “We provide visibility”
✅ “We help companies adapt”

This keeps you safe, credible, and fundable.

---

## FINAL COACHING ADVICE (IMPORTANT)

Right now:

* **Sell insight manually**
* **Build only what closes deals**
* **Charge early**

Your first goal is NOT scale.
Your goal is **signal**.

Once you have:

* 10 paying users
* Weekly usage
* Clear retention

Everything else becomes easy.
