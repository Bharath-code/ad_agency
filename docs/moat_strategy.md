### What This Enables

| Data Asset | User Value | Competitor Barrier |
|------------|------------|-------------------|
| **Industry benchmarks** | "You're better than 60% of SaaS tools" | Needs 100+ companies per vertical |
| **Historical trends** | "Your visibility improved 23% in 6 months" | Needs 12+ months of data |
| **Query effectiveness** | "These 5 queries predict conversions" | Needs outcome data correlation |
| **Competitor patterns** | "Notion always wins on X queries" | Needs cross-customer data |
| **Predictive insights** | "You'll lose visibility if Y happens" | Needs ML on longitudinal data |

### Timeline to Moat

| Milestone | Users Needed | Time | What Unlocks |
|-----------|--------------|------|--------------|
| Basic benchmarks | 100 | Month 6 | "Better than average" |
| Industry verticals | 500 | Month 12 | Per-industry insights |
| Predictive features | 2,000 | Month 24 | "What will happen" |
| Unassailable | 10,000 | Month 36 | Impossible to replicate |

---

## Moat 2: Switching Costs

### What Creates Lock-In

| Factor | Why They Stay | Time to Build |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| **Historical data** | "I have 2 years of trends here" | Automatic |
| **Team workflows** | "My whole team checks this weekly" | 3-6 months |
| **Integrations** | "It posts to our Slack and Notion" | 6 months |
| **Report archives** | "All our investor reports use this" | 6 months |
| **Custom queries** | "We've tuned 50 queries for our niche" | 3 months |

### High-Switching-Cost Features

1. **Weekly email → Inbox habit** — They'd miss the Monday email
2. **Slack integration** — Team expects the update
3. **Trend exports** — Board decks use our data
4. **Custom query library** — Invested time tuning
5. **Historical comparison** — Can't replicate elsewhere

---

## Moat 3: Brand & Category Ownership

### The Category Play

**Goal:** When someone says "AI visibility," they mean us.

Like:
- "Kleenex" = tissue
- "Google" = search
- "Figma" = design collaboration

**Our play:** "AVI" = AI visibility

### How to Own the Category

| Action | Impact | Timeline |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Coin "AI Visibility Score" | Others use OUR term | Month 1-3 |
| Monthly "State of AI Visibility" report | Press coverage | Month 3-6 |
| Guest on 50 podcasts | Credibility | Month 6-12 |
| Write THE book on AI visibility | Authority | Month 12-24 |
| Speak at SaaStr, MicroConf | Founder credibility | Year 1-2 |

### Brand Trust Compounds

```
Year 1: "Who is AVI?"
Year 2: "I've heard of AVI"
Year 3: "Everyone uses AVI"
Year 4: "AVI invented this category"
```

# PART 2: DIFFERENTIATION

## Why We're Different (Forever)

### 1. We're Built for Founders, Not SEO Managers

| Us | SEO Tools |
|----|-----------|
| "What to change on your landing page" | "Your domain authority is 34" |
| 5 minutes to understand | PhD in SEO required |
| 1 dashboard | 47 dashboards |
| $49/mo | $299/mo |

### 2. We Analyze AI, Not Google

| Us | Traditional |
|----|-------------|
| "ChatGPT recommends Notion over you" | "You rank #7 on Google" |
| Positioning insights | Backlink counts |
| Why you're losing | Raw metrics |

### 3. We Tell You WHAT TO DO

| Us | Others |
|----|--------|
| "Update your tagline to mention X" | "Your visibility is low" |
| 3 actionable fixes | Dashboards of data |
| Weekly priority email | Login to check |

---

## Positioning Statement

> "The only AI visibility tool built specifically for SaaS founders who want to know exactly why ChatGPT recommends their competitors — and what to change this week to win."

---

# PART 3: 10x VALUE

## The Value Math

### Current State (Without AVI)

| Problem | Time Spent | Outcome |
|---------|------------|---------|
| Manually asking ChatGPT | 2 hrs/week | Inconsistent |
| Guessing what to fix | 5 hrs/week | Random changes |
| Competitor monitoring | 3 hrs/week | FOMO-driven |
| **Total** | **10 hrs/week** | **No clarity** |

### With AVI

| Solution | Time Spent | Outcome |
|----------|------------|---------|
| Automated weekly scan | 0 hrs | Consistent data |
| Prioritized fix list | 30 min to read | Clear direction |
| Competitor comparison | 0 hrs | Automated |
| **Total** | **30 min/week** | **Full clarity** |

**Time savings:** 9.5 hours/week = **38 hours/month**

**Founder hourly rate:** ~$200/hr

**Value delivered:** 38 × $200 = **$7,600/month**

**We charge:** $49-149/month

**ROI:** 50-150x

---

## 10x Value Breakdown

### 1. Knowledge You Couldn't Get Otherwise

**Before:** "I wonder if ChatGPT recommends us..."
**After:** "We appear in 14 of 30 high-intent queries, up from 9 last month"

**Value:** Certainty you can't get any other way. **Priceless.**

---

### 2. Time Saved

| Task | Old Way | AVI Way | Savings |
|------|---------|---------|---------|
| Check AI mentions | 30 min/query × 30 queries | 0 (automated) | 15 hrs/week |
| Track competitors | Manual spreadsheet | Dashboard | 3 hrs/week |
| Decide what to fix | Guess | Prioritized list | 5 hrs/week |
| Report to team | Build manually | Forward email | 1 hr/week |

**Total:** 24+ hours/week saved

---

### 3. Money Made (Indirect)

| Scenario | Impact |
|----------|--------|
| Win 1 more AI recommendation | +X% discovery traffic |
| Fix positioning gap | Better conversion |
| Beat competitor in 5 queries | Capture their leads |

**Conservative estimate:** If AI drives 10% of discovery, and we improve visibility by 20%, that's 2% more leads.

For a SaaS making $50k MRR, that's **$1,000/month** in new revenue.

**We charge:** $49-149 = **7-20x ROI**

---

### 4. Confidence Gained

| Old Feeling | New Feeling |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Are we even mentioned?" | "Yes, in 14 queries" |
| "Why do they win?" | "They emphasize X, we don't" |
| "What should I fix?" | "These 3 things, in this order" |
| "Is it getting better?" | "Up 12% this month" |

**Value:** Sleep at night, focus on building. **Priceless.**

---

## The 10x Features

| Feature | Value Multiple |
|---------|----------------|
| **Visibility Score** | Clarity = 10x |
| **Competitor Why** | Intelligence you can't get anywhere = 10x |
| **Priority Fixes** | Time saved deciding = 10x |
| **Weekly Email** | No logins required = 2x convenience |
| **Historical Trends** | Progress tracking = 5x motivation |
| **Industry Benchmarks** | Context for score = 5x understanding |

---

## The 10x Promise

> "Know exactly where you stand in AI recommendations, why competitors win, and what to change — in 30 minutes a week instead of never knowing at all."

### Tagline Options for 10x Message

1. "Stop guessing. Start knowing."
2. "See what you've been missing."
3. "The visibility you can't get anywhere else."
4. "Every week: your score, their advantage, your fix."
