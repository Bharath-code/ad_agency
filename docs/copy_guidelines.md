## Onboarding Copy

### Step 1: Create Project

```
What's your product called?
───────────────────────────
Enter your product or company name. This is what we'll look for in AI answers.

Example: "Notion", "Figma", "Linear"
```

### Step 2: Add Description

```
How would you describe it?
──────────────────────────
A short description helps us ask better questions. Use your tagline or one sentence.

Example: "A project management tool for software teams"
```

### Step 3: Add Competitors

```
Who are your competitors?
─────────────────────────
We'll check if AI recommends them when asked about your category.

Add at least 2 for meaningful comparison.
```

## Tooltips & Hints

### Visibility Score

```
Your visibility score shows how often your product appears in AI answers
to common intent queries for your category. Higher is better.

Calculated from 30 queries × 3 samples each.
```

### Confidence Level

```
We run each query 3 times to ensure accuracy.

• High: All 3 samples agree
• Medium: 2 of 3 samples agree
• Low: Results varied significantly
```

### Competitor Advantage

```
This shows why AI recommended your competitor instead of you.
Use these insights to improve your positioning.
