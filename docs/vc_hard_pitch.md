# 1️⃣ HARD-NUMBERS VERSION (INVESTOR MODE)

Use this when investors ask: *“Show me the math.”*

---

## 🔢 MARKET MATH (BOTTOM-UP, CREDIBLE)

### Initial ICP (deliberately narrow)

* Global B2B SaaS companies with revenue teams: **~2.5M**
* Early-stage + indie + SMB SaaS (your first market): **~400k**

### Realistic early penetration

* 1% of 400k = **4,000 customers**

### ARPU (conservative)

* Weighted avg plan = **$99/month**
* Annual = **$1,188/customer**

### Revenue

* 4,000 × $1,188 = **$4.75M ARR**

This is **without** enterprise, agencies, or upsells.

> Investor takeaway: “Small penetration → meaningful business.”

---

## 📈 GROWTH MODEL (HOW THIS SCALES)

### Acquisition

* Founder-led sales (early)
* Community + content (mid)
* Tool-driven inbound (late)

### Conversion assumptions (conservative)

* Free scan → paid: **25–35%**
* Monthly churn: **<5%** (weekly report loop)
* Payback period: **<1 month**

### Expansion revenue

* Indie → Startup upgrades
* Add-on audits ($499 one-time)
* Team plans later

---

## 💸 UNIT ECONOMICS (ROUGH BUT HONEST)

### Costs (per customer / month)

* LLM usage: $2–5
* Infra + email: $3
* Total COGS: **<$10**

### Gross margin

* $99 – $10 = **~90% gross margin**

> Investor takeaway: “This prints clean SaaS margins.”

---

## ⏱️ TIMELINE TO SCALE

* Month 1–3: Founder sales, MVP
* Month 4–6: $5–10k MRR
* Month 9–12: $30–50k MRR
* Month 18: Hire sales / growth
* Month 24: Category leadership narrative

# 2️⃣ SIMULATED PARTNER MEETING Q&A (REAL TALK)

This is how **top-tier partners** will push you.

---

### ❓ Partner: *“Why doesn’t OpenAI just build this?”*

**Your answer**

> “Platforms historically don’t build visibility tools for businesses because it conflicts with neutrality and focus. Google never built Ahrefs or SEMrush.”

Pause.

> “Also, our value comes from cross-model, longitudinal behavior data—not a single platform.”

---

### ❓ Partner: *“Is this defensible, or will agencies copy it?”*

**Your answer**

> “Agencies sell labor. We sell data + workflow. Once founders rely on weekly AI visibility reports, switching costs kick in.”

Then:

> “This becomes infrastructure, not a service.”

---

### ❓ Partner: *“What if AI answers stop mentioning products?”*

**Your answer**

> “Then omission becomes even more important. Companies still need to know how they’re being described—or excluded.”

Key phrase:

> “Visibility matters whether the answer is positive or silent.”

---

### ❓ Partner: *“Is this just SEO with a new name?”*

**Your answer**

> “Yes—and that’s exactly why it works. Every distribution shift creates a new analytics layer.”

Then:

> “SEO wasn’t obvious until traffic moved there. This is the same moment.”

---

### ❓ Partner: *“What’s the biggest risk?”*

**Your answer**

> “Market education. But founders are already asking these questions—we’re not creating demand, we’re organizing it.”

---

### ❓ Partner: *“Why are YOU the right founder?”*

**Your answer**

> “I’m technical, close to customers, and building this alongside real founder pain—not speculating from the outside.”

Keep it grounded.

---

### ❓ Partner: *“What’s the 10x outcome?”*

**Your answer**

> “Owning the AI distribution analytics category. Every company checks us the way they check analytics today.”

Stop there.
