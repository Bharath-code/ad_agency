## The 30-Second Explanation

**Problem:** When someone asks ChatGPT "What's the best project management tool?", you have no idea if they mention you. You don't know if they're recommending your competitor instead. And you definitely don't know why.

**Solution:** We ask those questions FOR you, analyze the answers, and show you:
1. Are you mentioned? →
2. If not, who is? And why?
3. What can you change to get mentioned?

**Result:** A clear score, clear gaps, and clear fixes — every week.

## Step-by-Step: How It Actually Works

### Step 1: You Tell Us About Your Product (2 minutes)

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Product Name:     Linear                               │
│  What it does:     Project management for software teams│
│  Competitors:      Jira, Asana, Monday.com              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

That's it. No integrations. No API keys. Just your name and competitors.

---

### Step 2: We Generate Intent Questions (Automatic)

We create 30 questions that your potential customers actually ask AI:

| Category | Example Questions |
|----------|-------------------|
| Best tools | "What's the best project management tool?" |
| Comparisons | "Linear vs Jira - which is better?" |
| Alternatives | "What are some Jira alternatives?" |
| Use cases | "Best tool for software team sprints?" |
| Recommendations | "What project tool should a startup use?" |

These are the questions that decide if AI sends you customers or your competitor.

---

### Step 3: We Ask AI (Every Week)

We send each question to ChatGPT and analyze the response:

```
QUESTION: "What's the best project management tool for startups?"

AI ANSWER: "For startups, I'd recommend Notion for its flexibility,
           Linear for software teams specifically, or Asana for 
           general project management..."

WE DETECT:
  ✓ Linear mentioned: YES
  ✓ Position: 2nd recommendation
  ✓ Context: "for software teams specifically"
  ✓ Competitors mentioned: Notion (1st), Asana (3rd)
```

### Step 4: We Score Your Visibility

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                            │
│              YOUR AI VISIBILITY SCORE                      │
│                                                            │
│                    ┌──────────┐                            │
│                    │          │                            │
│                    │    47%   │                            │
│                    │          │                            │
│                    └──────────┘                            │
│                                                            │
│         Mentioned in 14 of 30 AI answers                   │
│                                                            │
│         ↑ 5% from last week                                │
│                                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**What this means:**
- 47% = You appear in about half the places customers might find you
- 14 of 30 = Specific number of questions where you're mentioned
- ↑ 5% = You're improving (or not)

---

### Step 5: We Show You the Gaps

For every question where you're NOT mentioned, we show who IS:

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  QUERY: "Best project management for remote teams"         │
│                                                            │
│  ❌ You're not mentioned                                   │
│                                                            │
│  ✓ Asana is mentioned because:                             │
│    • They emphasize "remote collaboration" in messaging    │
│    • Their landing page mentions "distributed teams"       │
│    • Reviews frequently mention remote work                │
│                                                            │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Now you know WHY you're losing that recommendation.**

## Under the Hood (Technical, Simple)

### What We Actually Do

```
1. SEND QUERY TO AI
   "What's the best project management tool?"
   
2. GET RESPONSE
   "I recommend Notion, Linear, and Asana..."
   
3. PARSE RESPONSE
   - Find brand mentions
   - Detect position (1st, 2nd, not mentioned)
   - Extract reasoning context
   
4. COMPARE TO COMPETITORS
   - Who's mentioned when you're not?
   - What phrases/features do they have?
   
5. GENERATE RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Pattern match: "Winners mention X, you don't"
   - Suggest specific copy/content changes
   
6. CALCULATE SCORE
   - % of queries where you appear
   - Weighted by query importance
```

### Why It's Reliable

| Concern | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "AI gives different answers" | We run each query 3 times and average |
| "Is this accurate?" | We show confidence levels |
| "Answers change over time" | We track trends, not just snapshots |

---

## The Value in One Screenshot

**BEFORE AVI:**
```
"I have no idea if ChatGPT recommends us. 
 I manually asked once, but who knows what it says now."
```

**AFTER AVI:**
```
"We're in 47% of AI answers, up from 32% last month.
 We fixed our remote messaging and gained 5 mentions.
 Asana is still ahead in 3 queries — working on those next."
```

---

## FAQ for Explaining to Others

### "How is this different from SEO?"

SEO = How Google ranks your website
AVI = Whether ChatGPT recommends your product

Different channels, different signals, different fixes.

### "Can you make AI recommend us?"

No. We analyze patterns and help you improve. We don't manipulate AI.

Think of it like: we can tell you "wear a better outfit for the interview" but we can't bribe the interviewer.

### "How often does this update?"

Weekly scans + weekly email reports. You can always run a manual scan in the dashboard.

### "What if AI doesn't recommend anyone in my category?"

Then you have a first-mover opportunity! We'll show you which queries have no good answers — and how to position yourself to win them.

## The Pitch to Different Audiences

### To a Founder (10 seconds)

> "We show you if ChatGPT recommends your product or your competitor — and what to fix."

### To a Marketer (30 seconds)

> "You know how SEO tools show your Google ranking? We do that for AI assistants. You get a visibility score, see which competitors are winning, and get specific copy changes to improve."

### To an Investor (60 seconds)

> "AI is becoming a new distribution channel. Millions ask ChatGPT for product recommendations. But nobody knows if they're being recommended. We give SaaS companies that visibility — a score, competitor analysis, and actionable fixes. Think 'Search Console for AI.'"

### To a Technical Person (30 seconds)

> "We run 30 intent queries against GPT-4o-mini weekly, parse responses for brand mentions, compare against competitors, and generate positioning recommendations. Confidence comes from 3x runs per query with majority voting."

---

## Summary

| What We Do | What You Get |
|------------|--------------|
| Ask AI your customers' questions | Know if you're recommended |
| Analyze who wins and why | Understand competitor advantage |
| Suggest specific changes | Clear action items |
| Track over time | See if changes work |
| Email weekly | Stay informed without logging in |

**Result:** You stop guessing and start knowing.
